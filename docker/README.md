# Docker

Docker helps you create a reproducible environment. You are able to specify the specific OS, the exact version of different libraries, different environment variables and their values among other things. Most importantly you are able to run your application in isolation inside of that environment.

Docker creates stand-alone packages called containers that contain everything that is needed for you to run your application. Each container gets its own CPU, memory and network resources and does not depend on a specific operating system or kernel.
